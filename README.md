[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spjeff/sppatchify/master/doc/download.png)](https://github.com/spjeff/sppatchify/releases/download/v0.129/SPPatchify.zip)

## NOTE
* May need to run `Enable-PSRemoting` and `Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role Server ` on all farm servers to allow PowerShell remoting before running this script.

## Business Challenge
* Long downtime
* Late staff hours
* Inconsistent procedures

## Technical Solution
* Supports SharePoint 2010, 2013, and 2016
* Auto detect farm
* Copy EXE to all servers
* Stop SharePoint services
* Run EXE in parallel
* Wait for all EXE and reboots to complete
* Run Config Wizard
* Start SharePoint services
* Display Central Admin
